## Project Overview
**Duan - Minecraft Forge Chinese Dev Documents Project**

This project aims to translate comments in Minecraft Forge and its Example Mod's source code,

based on which we will make an unofficial Chinese documentation for Minecraft Forge.

"Duan" is the Pinyin spelling of Chinese character "锻", meaning "forging" in Chinese.
## Language Use in Our Project
This repo will display Forge and its Example Mod's comments in both Chinese and English.

Both Chinese and English are retained, for easy access by developers with a certain level of English,

and to avoid the risk of possible ambiguity.

If you prefer a Chinese-only version, please check [0999312/Duan](https://github.com/0999312/Duan)。
